THIS IS WHAT WE DID FOR ASK SAGE.
EXAMPLE (SMALL CUT FROM REAL THING):We are hosted on Azure Government and our backups are stored in the Azure Backup vault on a daily basis for all our resources and hourly basis for SQL backups.
Our vector database which hosts our CUI customer data is backup every day.
We have Bicep automation to spin up an entire Ask Sage enclave or replica within a couple of hours on any Azure Gov region.
Our Azure OpenAI APIs runs on dedicated enclaves on Azure commercial FedRAMP high regions with two redundant APIs on East Coast and Central US.
For end users, Ask Sage allows username/pw but this does NOT enable access to CUI. Only CAC authenticated users get access to datasets with CUI with MANUAL assignment from our team after verification of their eligibility. For cloud administrative access on our side, Ask Sage leverages MFA with Azure MFA one time password options. For Ask Sage administrative access Ask Sage leverage either CAC or MFA one time password options.
Ask Sage has a full RBAC stack for all our cloud security/services but Ask Sage also brings a full Label Based Access Control to assign datasets to users based on need to know with MANUAL verification of CUI need to know by our team.
Ask Sage is hosted on Azure Government at IL5. It runs on Kubernetes using AKS. CUI information is stored in our vector database in a container inside of AKS on Azure Government at IL5. The datasets are labels and datasets that has CUI data are labeled with "CUI" in the name. Those CANNOT be accessed without CAC authentication and are MANUALLY assigned by our administrators to users based on need to know. When Ask Sage end users ingest data, they are NOT allowed Saged to create a dataset with CUI in it UNLESS they authenticated with a CAC. Our Web Application Firewall prevents all access from foreign nations and only whitelisted NATO countries can access Ask Sage. Only users with CAC can access CUI.
Ask Sage is a very lean team and only one person has access to administrative access at this time alongside our Microsoft selected partners.

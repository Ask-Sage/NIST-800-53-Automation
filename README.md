This python app generates NIST 800 53 control implementation for each control and generate the CSV file.

Make sure to edit app.py with your email, api_key, replacing the URL endpoints and more importantly customizing your prompts.

We recommend you write the NIST 800 171 controls (110 controls) by hand, with as much detail as possible and copy and paste that column in the security_context variable.

WARNING: this script will consume a lot of tokens, probably around $300 to $500 of GPT4 tokens!
